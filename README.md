## Purpose
The main goal of the task is the detection of the emotional state of a person that looks at a companyâ€™s
advertisement. Therefore, an algorithm that accurately classifies the three emotional expressions
joy, anger, or fear will be developed. The implementation of the project will be done with the help of
Python in PyCharm. The final product can detect one of the three emotional states or none when
receiving an unlabelled picture of a face.

This application was created due as a part of a university project (Data Science) and \
focuses on the backend processes in Python. 

##Requirements & Installation

###Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- questionary module
- pytest module

###Installation
1. Install Python (at least Python 3.8) on your computer
(Find the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
2. Install the module ```questionary``` by typing ```pip install questionary``` into the console.
3. Install the module ```pytest``` by entering ```pip install pytest``` into the console.


**The Program is ready to run now**

## Usage

1. Download all the documents in folder habit tracker and save in a folder on your computer.
2. Start the document ```main.py```.
3. Type in your Terminal ```python main.py```.
4. Follow the instruction on your screen.
5. When the program starts, a list of all currently created habits is displayed.
6. In the main menu, habits can be created, deleted, changed and incremented.
7. In the analysis tool, current streaks and a list of created habits can be viewed.
8. The program is not case-sensitive.
9. To check a habit, it has to be incremented in the respective time interval (daily / weekly).
10. If you forgot to submit a check, it can also be done retrospectively.


## Tests

The test module ```pytest``` is used to test the most relevant functions of the habit tracker.

Therefore, test cases can be tested typing ```pytest .``` in the Terminal.
For proofing the functionality of the application, \
the basic functionalities including the counting
of the current streak are presented in the test_project.py file.

##Contribution
This was my first Python Project. Any improvements or remarks from your side can help me. \
Feel free to help me to improve the application or reporting any detected bug. Thank you :)
