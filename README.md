## Purpose
The main goal of the task is the detection of the emotional state of a person that looks at a companyâ€™s
advertisement. Therefore, an algorithm that accurately classifies the three emotional expressions
joy, anger, or fear will be developed. The implementation of the project will be done with the help of
Python in PyCharm. The final product can detect one of the three emotional states or none when
receiving an unlabelled picture of a face.

This application was created due as a part of a university project (Data Science).

### 2. Requirements

   That means, the images with different tags must be copied in ```none```, for Training and Testing.
5. Load the code from ```project_AI.py``` to your development IDE and run to train the algorithm. Please adjust the path in the code correctly.
6. Load the code from ```Project_AI_Execute.py``` into your development IDE and run for classifying a new picture that is secured as picture on your computer. Please adjust the path in the code correctly.
7. The result will be shown in your console.
